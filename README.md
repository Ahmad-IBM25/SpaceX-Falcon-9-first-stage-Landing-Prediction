# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction
Training Project

Project background and context:
SpaceX has carried out hundreds of launches with varying outcomes. With its increasing frequency of missions and the strategic importance of reusability and cost-efficiency, understanding the drivers of mission success is crucial. This project aims to extract insights from past launches and build predictive tools that could assist with future mission planning and risk assessment.

Problems you want to find answers? 
Which launch sites are most reliable in terms of success rate? 
How does payload mass correlate with mission outcome?
Are certain booster versions or orbit types more successful?
Can we predict the success of a mission based on its configuration before launch?
